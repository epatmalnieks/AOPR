  <h4>Keepers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A team may keep up to two players from the previous year</li>
    <li>
      The amount paid for that player will be increased incrementally each year
      that player is kept by $5
    </li>
    <li>There is no limit for how many years a player can be kept</li>
    <li>
      A player that was a free agent acquisition is not eligible to be kept
    </li>
    <li>A player that was dropped is not eligible to be kept</li>
    <li>
      Keepers will be due the day of the draft. League owners will write their
      keepers down and silently give them to the commissioner.
    </li>
    <li>
      Example: Tom Brady has been drafted for $25 in 2021. Tom Brady's keeper
      cost in 2022 would be $30. The team that owns Brady would then begin the
      auction with a total of $270 (normally $300 without any keepers)
    </li>
