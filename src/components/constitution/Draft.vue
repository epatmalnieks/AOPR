  <h3>Draft</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The nomination order will correlate with the bingo balls drawn
      <a href="#drawing-for-divisions">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>Each owner has a default salary cap of $300 without any keepers</li>
    <li>
      A player is nominated for auction by the next owner up in the nomination
      order
    </li>
    <li>
      Bidding begins after an opening bid is declared by the owner who nominated
      the player
    </li>
    <li>The minimum opening bid is $0</li>
    <li>The minimum up-bid is $1</li>
    <li>
      Once there is a gap between bids, the auctioneer will begin the countdown
      to close bidding by announcing, "Going once...Going twice...SOLD!"
    </li>
    <li>
      Any bids made once the auctioneer begins saying "SOLD!" will not be valid
    </li>
    <li>
      The team with the highest bid receives that player on their team and the
      amount bid is deducted from the team's salary cap
    </li>
    <li>
      Cash leftover from the auction for each team will be added to the team's
      auction budget for the next year's draft ($50 maximum)
    </li>
  </ul>
